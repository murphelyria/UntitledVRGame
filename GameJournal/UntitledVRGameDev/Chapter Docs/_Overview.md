## Chapter 1
- Player is introduced to the Prime World, Corporate Hellscape, don't know if I want this to be boring or cyberpunk, like offices or cityscapes, I think starting really bland is smart
- Somewhere in this chapter we need to establish how the player gets thrown from world to world (this is a linear ability, not something the player actively uses until much later) and finish with them jumping to another dimension after a quick sequence showing off a bunch of dimensions
- Due to being primarily story, we can either leave this as mainly world introduction, or we can also include an element of stealth/evasion tactics

## Chapter 2
- Alpha World - introduction of guns, this needs to be a high tech world, focus should be on getting the player familiar with combat mechanics
- Player meets their counterpart in this world (not immediately clear, as their counterpart should be opposite gender of initial player), who gives them their weapons, and also should be suspiciously okay with the concept of dimensional hopping

## Chapter 3
- Beta World - this is going to introduce the concept that equipment of any given world is most effective in its world of origin, so the guns will reload slower in this world than in Alpha World, to encourage the players to use a combination of stealth and combat to get through, also use this location to introduce a melee weapon
- This world is a post-apocalyptic version of the city, allowing the player to explore more, but also they have to deal with zombies (come up with a better name), focusing more on environmental puzzles than combat or stealth
- End chapter with the player escaping from a large monster, will come back later on when revisiting this world
